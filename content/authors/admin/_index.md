Currently a PhD candidate at the Paris School of Economics, I use tools such as R, Stata, and QGIS to study attitudes, interpersonal dynamics, and conflict. I also teach undergraduate economics at Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne.

From the Paris School of Economics, I am well trained in using quantitative tools, including R, Stata, and GIS, to analyze data for policy relevant insights. In addition, I have the theoretical underpinnings in topics such as education, development, political economy, and public economics to put them into context.

In years 2020 and 2021, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Stockholm School of Economics on topics such as immigration, education, political representation, and COVID-19.
