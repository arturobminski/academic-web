I am a PhD candidate in migration and political economy at the Paris School of Economics. Using Python, R, Stata, and QGIS, with big data, experiments, and administrative data, I study international migration, attitudes, educational choices, and health. I am also affiliated with Universit√© Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne, where I have taught Statistics and Econometrics, the Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI) at Stockholm University, the Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (Misum) at the Stockholm School of Economics, and the Institut Convergences Migrations.

From Whispr Group, I have 10 years of experience analyzing structured and unstructured qualitative and quantitative data to find and deliver insights to executives in a range of sectors. In addition, through my academic and work experience, I have solid theoretical underpinnings in topics such as education, economic development, political economy, and public economics to put them into context.

My most recent awards are:

üèÖ **Young Economist Best Presentation Award**, from the [Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)](https://cepr.org) and the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage), sponsored by UniCredit Foundation and Marco Fanno Association, in July 2025

üèÖ **Best Paper Prize**, at the [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)](https://www.ebrd.com) and [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk) Workshop on the Economics and Politics of Migration, sponsored by Standard Error Editors, in May 2025
