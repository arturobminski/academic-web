Better understanding society, and sharing my insights, is fundamental to most of what I do.

From the Paris School of Economics, I am well trained in using quantitative tools, including R, Stata, and GIS, to analyze data for policy relevant insights. In addition, I have the theoretical underpinnings in topics such as education, development, political economy, and public economics to put them into context.

Currently, as a Research Assistant at the Stockholm School of Economics, I work on topics such as immigration, education, political representation, and the COVID-19 epidemic.
