Joint work with Donia Kamel and Javier Soria Espín.

We analyze culturally linked preferences and norms as determinants of educational and occupational choices, with a focus on second generation migrants in Sweden. We also analyze the labor market sorting effects of such preferences.

The analyses are conducted using registry data from Statistics Sweden, with ethics approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority.
