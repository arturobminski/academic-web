title: Hyper-Local Behavioral Responses to Ukrainian Migration to Poland
summary: Using machine learning and natural language processing methods applied to novel big data of 4.2 million establishment reviews, and with a discrete choice model, I analyze the consumption patterns of Polish natives and Ukrainian migrants and reactions to outgroup contact, with a focus on whether individuals shift away from or to neighborhoods with higher outgroup presence.

Using machine learning and natural language processing methods applied to novel big data of 4.2 million establishment reviews, and with a discrete choice model, I analyze the consumption patterns of Polish natives and Ukrainian migrants and reactions to outgroup contact, with a focus on whether individuals shift away from or to neighborhoods with higher outgroup presence.

I also study which types of establishments are conducive to successful integration and how local determinants, individual socio-demographic factors, and media coverage, affect these outcomes. I do so in the context of the immigration of more than one million Ukrainian refugees to Poland since the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
