title: "Choosing Distance: How Natives Reduce Migrant Exposure in Daily Life"
summary: This paper provides evidence of natives’ segregation from potential migrant exposure in response to the arrival of migrants to local neighborhoods. In March and April 2022, over one million Ukrainian refugees arrived in Poland. I find that, in response, natives shifted away from restaurants, stores, and other consumption locations with increased migrant presence in their immediate vicinity. This effect was especially pronounced for locations that facilitate social mixing. Moreover, it was reinforced by the opening of new locations that primarily attracted natives. These findings underscore the importance of considering how individual choices influence the likelihood of realizing potential benefits from intergroup contact.
