title: "Choosing Distance: How Natives Reduce Migrant Exposure in Daily Life"
summary: Interactions with natives are critical for migrants’ economic and social integration, yet segregation often limits such interactions. This paper asks whether natives adjust their choices of restaurants, stores, and other consumption locations in ways that reduce their exposure to migrants. I address this question using granular data on 43,000 individuals’ consumption across Poland, exploiting the sudden arrival of over one million Ukrainian refugees in 2022. I find that natives shifted away from locations with higher migrant presence, especially those that facilitate social mixing. New establishment openings reinforced this pattern, underscoring how individual choices can constrain the potential benefits of intergroup contact.
