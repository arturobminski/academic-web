Using machine learning and natural language processing methods applied to novel big data on mobility patterns, I analyze the causes and effects of Ukrainian refugees' mobility to and in Poland in relation to the escalation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022.

I study questions related to the determinants of Ukrainians' mobility patterns and choices of settlement location, intergroup interactions and attitudes, and refugees' investment in long term settlement and labor market participation.
